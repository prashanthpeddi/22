        <p style="background-color: rgb(203, 237, 218);font-weight: bold;">The show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain.

            Principal photography for the first season was scheduled to begin on July 26, 2010;[95] the primary location was the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast, Northern Ireland.[96] Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains (standing in for Vaes Dothrak); Castle Ward (Winterfell); Saintfield Estates (the Winterfell godswood); Tollymore Forest (outdoor scenes); Cairncastle (the execution site); the Magheramorne quarry (Castle Black); and Shane's Castle (the tourney grounds).[97] Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, was also used in the original pilot episode for scenes at Winterfell.[98] The producers initially considered filming the entire series in Scotland, but decided on Northern Ireland because of the availability of studio space and tax credits.[99]</p>

            <h2 id="chapter2" style="color: chartreuse;">CHAPTER-2</h2>
            <p style="background-color: rgb(223, 194, 194);font-weight: bold;">The series has been praised by both television critics and historians for what was perceived as a sort of medieval realism.[15][16][17] George R. R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre.[18][19][20] Martin has said that, "the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves".[21] Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy.[22][23][24] A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world.[25] Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change.[26] The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies</p>

                <h2 id="chapter3" style="color: darkgoldenrod;">CHAPTER-3</h2>
                <p style="background-color: rgb(14, 247, 247);font-weight: bold;">In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers.[28] Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed.[29] In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed "plot armor" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.[28] In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.[30] A scientific study conducted in 2018 stated that about 60% of the major characters died as a result of violence and war.</p>

                        <h2 id="chapter4" style="color: fuchsia;">CHAPTER-4</h2>
                        <p style="background-color: rgb(237, 213, 124);font-weight: bold;">A principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) between the houses of Lancaster and York, reflected in Martin's houses of Lannister and Stark.[38] The scheming Cersei Lannister evokes Isabella, the "She-Wolf of France" (1295–1358).[33] She and her family, as portrayed in Maurice Druon's historical novel series, The Accursed Kings, were a main inspiration of Martin's.[39] Other historical antecedents of series elements include: Hadrian's Wall (which becomes Martin's Wall), the Roman Empire, and the legend of Atlantis (ancient Valyria), Byzantine Greek fire ("wildfire"), Icelandic sagas of the Viking Age (the Ironborn), the Mongol hordes (the Dothraki), the Hundred Years' War, and the Italian Renaissance.[33] The series's popularity has been attributed, in part, to Martin's skill at fusing these elements into a seamless, credible version of alternate history.</p>

                            <p style="background-color: rgb(233, 143, 143);font-weight: bold;">Third-season production returned to Dubrovnik, with the Walls of Dubrovnik, Fort Lovrijenac, and nearby locations again used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep.[104] Trsteno Arboretum, a new location, is the garden of the Tyrells in King's Landing. The third season also returned to Morocco (including the city of Essaouira) to film Daenerys's scenes in Essos.[105] Dimmuborgir and the Grjótagjá cave in Iceland were used as well.[102] One scene, with a live bear, was filmed in Los Angeles.[106] The production used three units (Dragon, Wolf and Raven) filming in parallel, six directing teams, 257 cast members and 703 crew members.[107] The fourth season returned to Dubrovnik and included new locations, including Diocletian's Palace in Split, Klis Fortress north of Split, Perun quarry east of Split, the Mosor mountain range and Baška Voda farther south.[108] Thingvellir National Park in Iceland was used for the fight between Brienne and the Hound.[102] The fifth season added Seville, Spain, used for scenes of Dorne, and Córdoba</p>
