            Principal photography for the first season was scheduled to begin on July 26, 2010;[95] the primary location was the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast, Northern Ireland.[96] Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains (standing in for Vaes Dothrak); Castle Ward (Winterfell); Saintfield Estates (the Winterfell godswood); Tollymore Forest (outdoor scenes); Cairncastle (the execution site); the Magheramorne quarry (Castle Black); and Shane's Castle (the tourney grounds).[97] Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, was also used in the original pilot episode for scenes at Winterfell.[98] The producers initially considered filming the entire series in Scotland, but decided on Northern Ireland because of the availability of studio space and tax credits.[99]</p>
